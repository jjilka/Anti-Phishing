1. INTRODUCTION 
The field of encryption is becoming very important in the present era in which information security is of utmost concern. Security is an important issue in communication and storage of images, and encryption is one of the ways to ensure security. Image encryption has applications in internet communication, multimedia systems, medical imaging, telemedicine, military communication, etc. Phishing has become one of the major issues in the recent times that have sent across an alarm for the internet users. The major reason of concern is the fact that phishing activity directly hits at us as it aims at securing our personal and sensitive information. In phishing, electronic mails or other form of communications are sent across to a specific targeted group of people asking for their credit card information, account details, usernames and passwords.

This project has developed one such technique that can curb the threat of anti-phishing by the use of CAPTCHA which can provide us an improved effectiveness of the existing anti-phishing techniques.
